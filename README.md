# LibMP

## Introduction

LibMP is a lightweight messaging library built on top of [LibGDSync APIs](https://github.com/gpudirect/libgdsync/tree/devel), developed as a technology demonstrator to easily deploy the GPUDirect Async technology in applications.

## Requirements

Basic LibMP requirements are:
- OpenMPI v1.10 or newer
- Mellanox OFED (MOFED) 4.0 or newer 
- Mellanox Connect-IB, ConnectX-4 HCAs or newer
- [LibGDSync](https://github.com/gpudirect/libgdsync#requirements)

To use GPUDirect Async in combination with GPUDirect RDMA:
- OpenMPI with CUDA support
- A recent CUDA Toolkit is required, minimally 8.0
- A recent display driver, i.e. r361, r367 or later, is required
- The Mellanox OFED GPUDirect RDMA kernel module, https://github.com/Mellanox/nv_peer_memory, is required to allow the HCA to access the GPU memory.


## Build

Use the *scripts/env_setup.sh* file to specify MPI_PATH, CUDA_PATH, LIBGDSYNC_PATH and LIBMP_PATH env vars useful for both LibMP and LibGDSync.

Use the *build.sh* script to build LibMP.

## Run

In *scripts* folder:
- wrapper.sh: sample script with some topology example
- test.sh: sample script to test all libmp examples and benchmarks

N.B. you need to create your own hostfile inside *scripts* directory

## Applications using GPUDirect Async by means of LibMP

- [HPGMG-FV Async](https://github.com/e-ago/hpgmg-cuda-async)
- [CoMD-CUDA Async](https://github.com/e-ago/CoMD-CUDA-Async)
- [Lulesh2 Async](https://github.com/e-ago/lulesh2-cuda-async)
